	<br>
	<i>“Creativity is to discover a question that has never been asked"</i> -- Kenya Hara
	<br><br>
	Creativity often comes from reframing ideas into new contexts, new scales and new functionalities; to look at your problem from a totally different perspective.  Reframe is a tool to help you do just that.
	<br><br>
	You upload the text that's been inspiring you recently--websites you've been perusing, papers you've been reading, the random notes that  you've been writing--and the tool juxtaposes it in unexpected ways to help provoke new associations and inspire radically new ideas.
	<br><br>
	These prompts will not always 'make sense'; but that's the point!  Allow yourself be open to ambiguity, embrace associations that seem irrelevant, use your imagination to inspire new interpretations and connections, and let this tool help disrupt your thinking...
	<br><br><br>
	<p style="font-size: 20px"><b>HOW DO I USE IT?</b></p>

	<br><br>
	<ul>
	<li> > Refresh (or click on the logo top left) to generate a new prompt and click on the white words to change just that term.</li><br>
	<li> > Click the save logo (bottom right) to save a jpg of any prompts that you like.</li><br>
	<li> > You can customize the prompts to include words related to the projects you’re working on by clicking the upload button on bottom right (next to save) and entering the url to a new google spreadsheet (create a new one <i><a href="https://sheets.new/" target="_blank">here</a></i> then publish it to the web and get the sharable url).</li><br>
	<li> > You can then copy/paste text, upload a pdf or url and click 'upload' and it should parse the text into your personalised spreadsheet and Reframe tool.</li>
	</ul>
	<br><br>
	<p style="font-size: 20px"><b>WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES TO INSPIRE ME?</b></p>
	<br>
	Here's how others have customised the prompts for their own projects:
	<br><br>
	> <i><a href="index.html" target="_blank">General design inspiration</a></i>
	<br><br>
	> <i><a href="http://sideways.media.mit.edu/designhumandesign_temp/police_project.html" target="_blank">Designing the Police</a></i> by Sands Fish

	<br><br><br>
	<p style="font-size: 20px"><b>IS THERE A WAY TO USE THIS OFFLINE?</b></p>
	<br>
	Yes! A physical instantiation of Reframe tool was also made in the form of a deck of cards for designers to use as a creative game to prompt new design ideas.  Designers can randomly select a series of cards that form a design prompt sentence that can provoke new design ideas.
	<br><br>
	Download a template of the cards to make your own <i><a href="designhumandesign Creative Prompt Cards.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a></i>
	<!-- The data is stored in a Google spreadsheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14h5eEvELe5eMX_6XF6G-tHDT8G1-FNJI3kADJE3ss3Q/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> if you would like to upload your own set of words inspired from your design research.
	<br><br>Delete the words that are there initially.  Then fill the 'Artifact' column with words related to what sort of end product you might create, 'Inspiration' with words relating to the topics that are guiding the theme of your project, 'Experience' with adjectives about the type of experience you would like to evoke, 'Attributes' with the elements of the prototypes you will be making, and 'Medium' with the types of media you want to experiment with.
	<br><br>The you will be able to access your personal creative prompt tool <a href="your_personalised_project.html">here.</a> -->
<!-- 	<br><br>**NOTE: this is a prototype so will be used by mulitple users at once and will not save your data.  Be sure to save your words in a separate file and upload them to this spreadsheet everytime you would like to use the tool.**</div> -->
